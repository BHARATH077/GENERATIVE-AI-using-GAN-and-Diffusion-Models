# GENERATIVE-AI-using-GAN-and-Diffusion-Models

##Abstract
This project investigates the efficacy of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and diffusion models in generating realistic facial images, particularly focusing on the creation of deepfakes. With the increasing concerns surrounding the misuse of synthetic media, understanding the strengths and limitations of these models is paramount. The research begins with an overview of GANs and diffusion models, exploring their architectures and underlying principles. Subsequently, a facial dataset is selected and preprocessed to ensure diversity and representativeness. Different GAN architectures and diffusion models are then implemented for image generation, with a specific emphasis on replicating facial features accurately. The generated images are subjected to thorough analysis, encompassing both visual inspection and quantitative evaluation metrics. Additionally, the detectability of the generated deepfakes is assessed using state-of-the-art detection tools. The findings reveal nuanced differences between GANs and diffusion models in terms of image quality, realism, and detectability. While GANs excel in producing visually appealing images, diffusion models demonstrate superior performance in preserving finer facial details. However, diffusion models are found to be more susceptible to detection by existing deepfake detection algorithms. The project concludes with a comprehensive discussion on the implications of these findings and identifies avenues for future research in the domain of synthetic media generation and manipulation.
